# Task_Manager
Site with task manager and task board

## Task:
Using Python 3 create a back-end and API for the task board application.

* Adding/editing users
* Adding/editing tasks
* Assigning tasks to users
* Changing task status (TO DO, IN PROGRESS, ON REVIEW, DONE)
* Storing the data

### Optional (nice to have) features:

* Deleting tasks and users
* Tests
* Simple web interface working with the API
